# cabs
This project simulates how ride-hailing apps like Uber find the best cab for a user. It reads real GPS locations from a JSON file, maps them to a virtual city grid, and finds the shortest path using Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms. The results — including the user, cabs, and shortest route — are shown on an ASCII grid in the terminal.
